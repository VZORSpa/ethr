**ETHR-lib**
*MicrisoftÂ® ethr as a library

this library is based on https://github.com/microsoft/ethr, this tool is really useful for captureing network traffic cross platform (windows,ljnux,macos) the downside was its functionality was limited a a terminal tool, we took away all the terminal shenanigans and left only the network performance data  accesible as a library.

We kept the licencing (MIT) and security files.

we also added some extra information to make the information more useful as: 

* HWAddrress added to the information struct
* network flags added to the information struct
* error packets count added to the information struct
* discard packets count added to the information struct
